# Breakpoint #

**Really Simple Media Queries with Sass**

Breakpoint makes writing media queries in Sass super simple. Create a variable using a simplified syntax based on most commonly used media queries, then call it using the `breakpoint` mixin.  Breakpoint handles all of the heavy lifting, from writing the media query itself, to handling cross-browser compatibility issues, so you can focus on what's important: making sure your website looks its best.

Breakpoint also allows you to get the [context of your media queries](https://github.com/canarymason/breakpoint#media-query-context) from your code, allowing you to write dynamic mixins based on their media query context.

If you'd prefer the semantic awesomeness of string names to identify your queries as opposed to variables, or want to dynamically generate media queries, check out the [Respond-To](https://github.com/snugug/respond-to) syntax, now included in Breakpoint core!

**It is important to note** that due to limitations within the Sass language itself, which themselve stem from some potentially unexpected cascading from doing so, Breakpoint is unable to concat like media queries into a single media query. This means they will be spread out throughout your CSS. This is unfortunate, yes, but currently unavoiadable. That being said, once [Sass Issue #241: Seperate Media/Browser Specific Markup to Separate Style Sheet](https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/241) hits, be sure we're going to take full advantage of it.

## Contributing to Breakpoint

We love contributors! Yes we do! If you would like to contribute to Breakpoint, please follow the following guidelines:

* We are actively trying to stay away from Ruby functionality and am attempting to build this entirely with native Sass functionality. If you would like to add a feature that includes Ruby code, there needs to be a very very compelling case as to why.
* Each individual feature you would like to add, or bug you would like to squash, should be an individual pull request. Each pull request should be from an individual feature branch to either the latest stable or development branch. **The current *stable* branch is 2.x.x. The current *development* branch is 2.x.x**. Contributions that are not in the form of a pull request will not be considered. If your pull request does not apply cleanly we will ask you to fix that before we will look into pulling it in. We may ask you to update or make changes to the code you've submitted, please don't take this the wrong way. If a pull request smells (such as if a large amount of code is all within a single commit, or the coding standards aren't in line with core Singularity) we may ask you to rewrite your commit.

## Awesome Things Built With Breakpoint

Breakpoint is designed to be a Media Query engine to power everything from design tweaks to media query contexts to full media query fallbacks. But we also know that our users will build awesome thing with these tools. Build a Breakpoint powered mixin for new media query semantics? We want to hear about it! Build something cool with Context? Let us know! If you would like to add your Awesome Thing to the list, please issue a Pull Request to add it!

Please update your settings as followins:

  * `$breakpoint-default-pair: value;` should become `@include bkpt-set('default pair', value);`
  * `$breakpoint-force-media-all: value;` should become `@include bkpt-set('force all media type', value);`

## 0.3
### June 18, 2012
* Rewrote 'device-pixel-ratio' conversions to change from prefixed nightmarish hell to Resolution standard based on the [W3C Unprefixing -webkit-device-pixel-ratio article](http://www.w3.org/blog/CSS/2012/06/14/unprefix-webkit-device-pixel-ratio/)

  * -moz's min/max is different than -webkit or -o, so prefixed differently
  * Opera is strange and needs its DPR in a ratio instead of a floating point number, so requires the fraction rubygem and has a numerator/denominator function to accommodate.
* Added ability to have single feature/value input be either have feature first or second

## 0.1

* extract breakpoint from survival kit to this gem
